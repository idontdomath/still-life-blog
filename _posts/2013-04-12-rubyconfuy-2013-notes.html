<h2>RubyConf Uruguay 2013 / Personal Notes</h2>
	
	<p>A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to assist to <a href="http://rubyconfuruguay.org/" target="_blank">RubyConf Uruguay</a>, in Montevideo.</p>
	<p>The decision to attend was delayed to the last minute, but luckily a call from a friend with a spare ticket, some work arrangements made it.</p>
	<p>Those were awesome and welcoming days in a city that I love, in which i was able to focus on some personal interests and think a bit out of the everyday box.</p>
	<p>During the conference, I took some notes of the talks, to capture some of the things that were mentioned and you can't find in the slides.</p> 
	<p>Probably the talks are going to be available in video in the future, but maybe this can help you in the short term, at least to point you at some direction.</p>
	<p>You can find them <a href="https://github.com/idontdomath/rubyconfuy2013-personal-notes">here</a>.</p>
